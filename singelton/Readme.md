# Singleton Design Pattern

## Overview

The Singleton design pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

## Implementation Details

In the [Singelton.java](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/HP/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html) file, the Singleton pattern is implemented with the following features:

* **Private Static Variable** : Holds the single instance of the class.
* **Private Constructor** : Prevents instantiation from other classes.
* **Public Static Method ([getInstance](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/HP/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html))** : Provides global access to the instance.
* **Double-Checked Locking with Volatile Variable** : Ensures thread safety and reduces synchronization overhead.

## Key Components

* **Volatile Keyword** : Ensures that multiple threads handle the [instance](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/HP/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html) variable correctly when it is being initialized.
* **Synchronized Block** : Used inside the [getInstance](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/HP/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html) method to provide thread-safe access to the singleton instance.
* **Lazy Initialization** : The instance is created only when it is needed, which can improve performance and resource usage.

## Benefits

* **Controlled Access** : Guarantees that only one instance of the class exists throughout the application.
* **Resource Optimization** : Reduces unnecessary memory usage by preventing multiple instances.
* **Consistency** : Provides a single point of access, ensuring consistent behavior across different parts of the application.

## Usage

* Access the singleton instance by calling the [getInstance](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/HP/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html) method with the required data parameter.
* The singleton instance can then be used throughout the application wherever it's needed.
